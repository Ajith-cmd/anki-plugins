# Schedule Priority

The goal of this addon is to let you define different intervals for some group of cards in a deck.

Suppose you have a deck and you to increase the interval when you marks an revision as good (for example).  
Currently you can do it using Anki through Deck Options. Now, lets say you want to customize the interval of only some cards. 
Through that "Deck Options" this is not possible, because it applies the options to the entire deck. 

## Setting a different time than those defined by Anki

Having this feature could interesting because in many times you want to use a customized time. 
Even if you remembered a given card as "good", sometimes you would like to review it again, before the given time.  

It's possible to do it somehow with a few addons. For instance:   

* Define any custom time you want, with a shortcut that asks you what interval you want; 
* Lots of extra buttons with customized times, for each one

These options do work. They need you to manually choose the interval that you desire in each revision.  
As you have so many options (especially with those buttons), sometimes you are not sure about which one to use in that time.  

### Then Schedule Priority Comes...

This addon creates customized interval based on the card (note) registry. So when you are studying it, the time is assigned automatically. No need to think about this detail during the review.
